- For loops and Models
- Links with Variables
- Forms

### Example 1
Create a House Model with address, buildDate, and numberOfBedrooms. Create two pages: index and details. The index should be a link with the house's name. That link should go to a details page that has a index link back to the index page and all of the houses attributes.

### Example 2
Create a page with a header and 4 forms below it: Add5, Subtract10, Multiply2, and Divide10. Each form should have an input field and button. When you click the submit button for each of the forms you should do the appropriate math for the integer input and show it at the top of the page or a different page. Your choice. If you show it on a different page make sure you have a link back to the home page.
